# RealTimeTextSearch

The intelligent analysis of text images is in wide demand now days. Text search is one of the important aspect of these analysis. In todayâ€™s world, no one wants to wait, and seek for fast information extraction. Here, this report presents the work on Text Search in real time. The current state of art is to first store down the image and then output the search result after processing it in OCR. This takes unnecessary storing of image and time for the same. This report describes real time text detection using mobile phones. We have developed an Android-platform based text searching application that is able to recognize the text, search the text string and display the bounding box around the text onto the screen of mobile in real time. In this report, we demonstrate the system flow, the text detection algorithm and detailed experiment result.
